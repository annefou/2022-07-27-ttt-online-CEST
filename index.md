<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->

<p>
<a href="{{ www.carpentries.org }}">The Carpentries</a> is a community of practice centered around teaching foundational 
  coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. This Instructor Training 
  event is designed to prepare trainees to certify and participate as Carpentries 
  Instructors. However, much of our curriculum focuses on educational principles that 
  apply across a wide variety of contexts. We also welcome participants who do not plan 
  to certify but simply wish to become a better teacher.
</p>

<p>Carpentries Instructor Training has the following goals:</p>
  
* Introduce you to evidence-based teaching practices.
* Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
* Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
* Help you become integrated into the Carpentries community.
* Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentries workshops.
  
<p> Because we have only limited time, some things are beyond the scope of this training. We will
not be learning:</p>
  
* How to program in R or Python, use Git or SQL, or any of the other topics taught in  <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a>, 
  <a href="{{ site.lc_site }}">Library Carpentry</a>, or 
  <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a> workshops.
* How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work if you are inspired to learn more).


<p>
Instructor Training events are hands-on throughout: short lessons alternate 
with individual and group practical exercises, including practice teaching sessions. 
This Instructor Training event is the first step towards certification as a 
Carpentries Instructor. For more details on the other 3 steps, see the <a href="{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/">Checkout Instructions</a> page.
For more information, see our <a href="{{ site.training_site }}">Instructor Training Curriculum</a>.

This is an online event and will be conducted using the Zoom video conferencing platform. No log-in is needed. 
However, if you have not used Zoom before, please click the link a few minutes early as it may prompt you to 
install the Zoom app or browser extension. You should have received a connection link in the same email that

please check your spam folder and email instructor.training@carpentries.org with your Trainers (contact details below) on cc.

<h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>

We are committed to making this workshop

Workshop organisers have checked that:

<ul>
  <li>The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.</li>
  <li>Accessible restrooms are available.</li>
</ul>

Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop. 
If we can help make learning easier for you in any way by 
providing additional support, accommodations, or assistance, 
please get in touch (using contact details below) and we will attempt to provide them.

{% endif %}

<h3>How to Prepare for Instructor Training</h3>
  
Before your training, please visit our Preparing for Instructor Training page for complete instructions. A brief summary of these instructions is as follows
<ol>
  <li>Complete our Pre-training Survey. You will receive a custom link for your event when you receive your connection information.</li>
  <li>Select a lesson to use for teaching practice sessions and prepare a 3 minute segment, spending no more than 20-30 minutes to prepare.</li>
  <li>Please read the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf">The Science of Learning</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://carpentries.org/files/reports/Carpentries2020AnnualReport.pdf">The Carpentries Annual Report</a></li>
    </ul> 
</ol> 

<h3> Checkout: The Instructor Certification Process</h3>
After the training event, we ask you to complete three follow-up tasks to become a certified Instructor. These requirements are detailed on our 
  <a href="{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/">Checkout Instructions</a> page and will be discussed at our training. 
  
<h3>What to Bring to an In-Person Event</h3>

Participants should bring a laptop that is Internet connected and has a
functioning browser. If you have it, a device for recording audio and video
(mobile phones and laptops are OK) is useful as we
are going to record one another teaching in pairs or threes. It does not have
to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what
someone is saying.

<h3>Attendance and Cancellation</h3>
Trainees who miss more than 1 hour of the training may be marked absent. 
Instructor certification cannot be completed without full attendance at 
an Instructor Training event. If you unexpectedly need to miss more than 
1 hour of your event, please contact your Trainers (contact info below). 

For events in which registration occurs through The Carpentries via Eventbrite, 
cancellation may be performed in Eventbrite up to the start of the event. 
Canceled seats cannot be filled after the 1 week registration deadline for these events, 
so we ask that you only cancel if absolutely necessary.

More information on our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/cancellations_and_makeups.html">cancellation and makeup policy</a> is available in The Carpentries Handbook.
