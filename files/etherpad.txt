In the Etherpad, write down your name, the best class you ever took (or one class from your top ten, if you can't decide), and what made it so great.

A Brief Overview of the Carpentries
https://carpentries.org/workshops/

Instructor Training Workshop Overview
How learning works
Building teaching skill
Creating a positive learning environment
Carpentry history and culture

Assessing Trainee Motivation and Prior Knowledge

Background (3 min)
Have you ever participated in a Software, Data or Library Carpentry Workshop?
 
Yes, I have taken a workshop. 
Yes, I have been a workshop helper.
Yes, I organized a workshop.
No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop. 
No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.
 
Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?
 
I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course. 
I have not had any teaching experience in the past. 
I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.
I have been the instructor-of-record for my own university/college course.
I have taught at the primary education level.
I have taught informally through outreach programs, hackathons, laboratory demonstrations, and similar activities.
  
Key Points:
The Carpentries are communities of practice. We strive to provide a welcoming environment for all learners and take our Code of Conduct seriously.
This episode sets the stage for the entire workshop. The introductions and exercises help everyone begin to develop a relationship and trust.
This workshop will cover general teaching pedagogy and how it applies specifically to the Carpentries.
Learner motivation and prior knowledge vary widely, but can be assessed with a quick multiple choice question.
 
 
II. Building Skill with Practice

The Carpentries Pedagogical Model

Acquisition of Skill
 https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/skill-level.svg
Novice
Competent practitioner
Expert

Cognitive Development and Mental Models (5 min)
In the Etherpad, write your primary research domain or area of expertise and some aspects of the mental model you use to frame and understand your work. What concepts/facts are included? What types of relationships are included?
 
 
 


The Importance of Going Slowly
https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/mental_models.svg

How "Knowledge" Gets in the Way

Misconceptions
Factual errors
Broken models
Fundamental beliefs

Identifying and Correcting Misconceptions
Formative assessment
Summative assessment

Repetition vs.Reflective practice

Formative Assessments Come in Many Forms

Identify the Misconceptions (10 min)
Choose one of the wrong answers to the question below and write in the Etherpad what the misconception is associated with that wrong answer.
Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32 
c) 312 
d) 33 
 
Handling Outcomes (10 min)
Formative assessments allow us as instructors to adapt our instruction to our audience. What should we do as instructors if the class votes for:
1. mostly one of the wrong answers?
2. mostly the right answer?
3. an even spread among options?

For one of the above, enter your answer below:
    
 
 
 

Modeling Novice Mental Models (10-15 min)
Take 10 minutes to create a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach. Type it into the Etherpad and explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors, i.e., what misconception is each distractor meant to identify?

 
Formative Assessments Should be Frequent

How Many? (5 min)
The Carpentries use formative assessments often. How many have we done since the start of this workshop? Put your guess in the Etherpad along with one example and the purpose that assessment served. 
 
 
 
 

Confronting the Contradiction (Optional)
Describe a misconception you have encountered in your own learning or teaching and how to get learners to confront it.

 
Key Points:
Our goal when teaching novices is to help them construct useful mental models.
This requires practice and feedback.
Formative assessments provide practice for learners and feedback to learners and instructors.
 
 
III. Expertise and Instruction

What Makes an Expert?

What Is an Expert? (5 min)
Name someone that you think is an expert (doesn't matter what they're an expert in). As an expert, what makes them special or different from other people?
 
 
 
 

What is something that you're an expert in? How does your experience when you're acting as an expert differ from when you're not an expert?
 
 
 
 

Connections and Mental Models

Limitations of Expertise

Fluid Representations (5 min)
Give at least one example of a fluid representation that you use in your own work. If you can, also give an example of a fluid representation that might occur in a Carpentry lesson.
 
 
 
 

Diagnosis (5 min)
What is an error message that you encounter frequently in your work? (These are often syntax errors.) Take a few minutes to plan out how you would explain that error message to your learners. Write the error and your explaination below.
 
 
 
 

Blind Spots (5 min)
Is there anything you're learning how to do right now? Can you identify something that you still need to think about, but your teacher can do without thinking about it?
 
 
 
 


Think about the area of expertise you identified earlier. What could a potential blind spot be?
 
 
 
 

Dismissive Language

Changing Your Language (5 min)
What other words or phrases can have the effect of demotivating learners? What alternatives can we use to express this meaning in a positive and motivational way? In the Etherpad, make a list of demotivating words/phrases and alternatives.
 
 
 
 

You Are Not Your Learners

The Importance of Practice (Again)

Key Points:
Experts face challenges when teaching novices due to expert blind spot.
Expert blind spot: knowing something so well that it seems easy when it's not.
With practice, we can learn to overcome our expert blind spot.
 
IV. Memory and Cognitive Load

Types of Memory

Test Your Working Memory (5 min)
This website (https://cat.xula.edu/thinker/memory/working/serial) implements a short test of working memory. You will be presented with a variety of different symbols, each presented for only a very short time, and asked to select those that you remember from a second set of symbols. There are 21 steps to the quiz, after which you can skip over the survey to see your results.

What was your score? Write your answer below.
 
 
 



Strategies For Memory Management

Improving Short-term Memory with Chunking (5 min) 
Repeat the memory exercise you did earlier, but this time, try to form short stories or phrases from the words you see.
Write the number of words you remembered in the Etherpad. How does this compare with your first attempt?
 
 
 
 


Active Learning Through Formative Assessment

Concept Maps as Instructional Planning Tools

Concept Mapping (10 min)
Create a hand-drawn concept map for a part of a Carpentries lesson you would teach in five minutes (ie. the amount of material you would teach before doing a formative assessment). You can use the same subject about which you created a multiple choice question, or a different subject. Trade with a partner, and critique each other's maps. Are there any concepts missing in your partner's map that you would include? Are there more than a handful of concepts in your map? If so, how would you re-divide those concepts to avoid overwhelming your learners' working memory?
Take 10 minutes to draw the concept maps and share with your neighbor. Write "done" in the Etherpad chat once you have finished.



Other Uses of Concept Maps

Why Guided-Practice is Important

Faded Examples

# total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
def total_length(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total
    
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
def word_lengths(words):
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
    
# concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
def concatenate_all(words):
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result

# acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
def acronymize(words):
    ____

Create a Faded Example from a Lesson (10 min)
The following exercise should be done in groups of 2-3.
Pick a block of code from an existing Carpentries lesson, or from another lesson you have taught recently.
Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
Write a question to test the student's ability to correctly fill in that blank.
Paste your faded example in the Etherpad.

Summary

Key Points
Most adults can store only a few items in short-term memory for a few seconds before they lose them again.
Things seen together are remembered (or mis-remembered) in chunks.
Teaching consists of loading short-term memory and reinforcing it long enough for items to be transferred to long-term memory.
Use formative assessments to avoid overloading short-term memory.

V. Building Skill with Feedback

Surveys
For links to our surveys see: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/#surveys

Minute Cards

One-Up, One-Down

Give Us Feedback (5 minutes)
Write one thing you learned this morning that you found useful on one of your sticky notes, and one question you have about the material on the other. Do not put your name on the notes: this is meant to be anonymous feedback. Add your notes to the pile by the door as you leave for lunch.

Key Points
Give your learners time to fill out the post-workshop survey at the end of your workshop.
Take the time to respond to your learners' feedback.

VI. Motivation and Demotivation

Creating A Positive Learning Environment
Presenting the instructor as a learner.
Establishing norms for interaction.
Encouraging students to learn from each other.
Acknowledging when students are confused.

Teach Most Useful First
https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/what-to-teach.png

Authentic Tasks: Think, Pair, Share (10 min)
Think about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach, 
(e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo) and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class. 
Pair up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of "short/long time to master" 
and "low/high usefulness". 
In the class Etherpad, Share the task and where it fits on the graph. 
As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our "teach most immediately useful first" approach.

Other Motivational Strategies

Strategies for Motivating Learners (5 min)
How Learning Works by Susan Ambrose, et al, contains this list of evidence-based methods to motivate learners.
In groups of two or three, pick three of these points and describe in one sentence in the Etherpad how can we apply these strategies in our workshops.
Strategies to Establish Value
Connect the material to students' interests.
Provide authentic, real-world tasks.
Show relevance to students' current academic lives.
Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' future professional lives.
Identify and reward what you value.
Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline.
Strategies to Build Positive Expectations
Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies.
Identify an appropriate level of challenge.
Create assignments that provide an appropriate level of challenge.
Provide early success opportunities.
Articulate your expectations.
Provide rubrics.
Provide targeted feedback.
Be fair.
Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.
Describe effective study strategies.
Strategies for Self-Efficacy
Provide students with options and the ability to make choices.
Give students an opportunity to reflect.


Brainstorming Motivational Strategies (5 min)
Think back to a computational (or other) course you took in the past, and identify one thing the instructor did that motivated you. Pair up with your neighbor and discuss what motivated you.Share the motivational story in the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 


Why Do You Teach? (5 min)
We all have a different motivation for teaching, and that is a really good thing! We want instructors with diverse backgrounds because you each bring something unique to our community.
What motivates you to teach? Write a short explanation of what motivates you to teach. Save this as part of your teaching philosophy for future reference.
 
 
 
 


How Not to Demotivate Your Learners

Brainstorming Demotivational Experiences (5 min)
Think back to a time when you were demotivated as a student (or when you demotivated a student). Pair up with your neighbor and discuss what could have been done differently in the situation to make it not demotivating. Share your story in the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 


Psychological Demotivators
Stereotype Threat
Impostor Syndrome
Accessibility Issues
Lack of Inclusivity

Overcoming Imposter Syndrome (Optional, 5 min)
Think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing. Is that task still hard for you? In the Etherpad, describe how you might you use this as a motivational story to help your learners overcome their own imposter syndrome.
 
 
 
 



Learning About Accessibility (5 min)
The UK Home Office has put together a set of posters  (https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf ) of dos and don'ts for making visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations. Take a look at one of these posters and put one thing you've learned in the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 


What Happens When Accessibility is an Issue? (Optional, 5 min)
Think of a time when you've been affected by, or noticed someone else being affected by issues with accessibility. This may have been at a conference you attended where the elevator was out of service, or maybe a class you were taking relied on audio delivery of content. Describe what happened, how it impacted your (or someone else's) ability to be involved and what could have been done to provide better accessibility in this case
 
 
 
 


Inclusivity

Key Points
A positive learning environment helps people concentrate on learning.
People learn best when they see the utility in what they're learning, so teach what's most immediately useful first.
Imposter syndrome is a powerful force, but can be overcome.
Accessibility benefits everyone.


VII. Mindset

The Importance of Mindset

Does Mindset matter? (5 min)
Think: What kind of mindset do you have about different areas? Is there anything you believe you are "not naturally talented" at? Mindset often varies in different areas -- someone might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic ability, but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill. Then, think about your learners. How might a learner's mindset about computational skill influence their learning in a workshop setting?
Pair: Discuss your thoughts about the influence of mindset in a workshop. Try to come up with a few different ways or situations in which mindset might be relevant.
Share: A few thoughts in the etherpad (or go around the room and discuss)


Praise Influences Mindset

Choosing our Praises (5 min)
Since we're so used to being praised for our performance, it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners. 
Which of these are examples of performance-based, effort-based, or improvement-based praise?
I like the way you tried a couple of different strategies to solve that problem.
You're getting really good at that. Keep up the hard work!
You're really talented.
That was a hard problem. You didn't get the right answer, but look at how much you learned trying to solve it!

Errors are Essential to Learning

Helping Learners Learn From Mistakes (5 min)
A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they've made an error that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between ls and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?
In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you would respond.
 
 
 
 


Perseverance Predicts Success

How Are You Gritty? (Optional, 5 min)
A previous exercise asked you to think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing.
How did you motivate yourself to continue learning? How did it feel to persist in the face of challenge? How do you feel now about your capabilities in this area?
In the Etherpad, describe how you could use this story to illustrate the importance of grit for your learners.
 
 
 
 


Habits of Lifelong Learners

Key Points
Growth mindset and grit promote learning by making effort a positive thing.
Presenting errors as essential to the learning process helps learners learn from their mistakes.
Successful lifelong learners aren't embarrassed to ask for help.

VIII. Teaching is a Skill

Lesson Study: Applying a Growth Mindset to Teaching

Giving Feedback (10 min)
We'll start by observing some examples of Carpentries-style workshop teaching and providing some feedback.
Watch this example teaching video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U) as a group and then give feedback on it. Put your feedback in the Etherpad. Organize your feedback along two axes: positive vs. negative and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said). 
Content +
 
Content -

Presentation + 
 
Presentation -
 

Feedback on Yourself (25 min)
Split into groups of three.
Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing to teach a 90-second segment of the lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course.
Get together with your group and have each person teach their segment to the group, while one person records this (video and audio) using a cell phone or some other handheld device. Use a whiteboard or other visual aids if available (Note: Do not live code you lesson. There will be a chance to live code later.) Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person.
After the first person finishes, rotate roles (they become the videographer, the audience becomes the instructor, the person who was recording becomes the audience) and then rotate roles again.
After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the videos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e., people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.
After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the main group and put everyone's feedback about you into the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 


Feedback Is Hard

Feedback on Feedback (Optional, 15 min)
Watch either this video(https://vimeo.com/139316669 ) (8:40) or this one (https://vimeo.com/139181120 ) (11:42). For each, give feedback following the 2x2 model. Put your feedback in the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 


Using Feedback (5 min)
Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching in an earlier exercise. How do you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?
Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on this feedback. Describe your change in the Etherpad.
 
 
 
 

Skill Acquisition: What level are your teaching skills? (Optional)
As with computational skills, people have a tendency to think of teaching as something you are "just good at" or not. However, teaching is a skill, and expertise develops with attentive practice. Examine the descriptions of "novice," "competent practitioner," and "expert." Where do you think you fall with regard to teaching? What have you learned about teaching? What are you aware of that you still need to learn? Discuss with a partner and then write some thoughts below.

Key Points
Like all other skills, good teaching requires practice and feedback.
Lesson study is essential to transferring skills among teachers.
Feedback is most effective when those involved share ground rules and expectations.

IX. Wrap-Up and Homework for Tomorrow

To prepare for tomorrow, please:
Read about the two types of Carpentries workshops: self-organized (http://www.datacarpentry.org/self-organized-workshops/ ) and centrally-organized (http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/ ) and the checklists these pages link to. 
Prepare for the live coding exercises. If you haven't already, pick an episode from an existing Software, Data or Library Carpentry lesson and read through it carefully. Tomorrow, you will use this to practice live coding for 3 minutes in groups of three. Your group members will comment on the delivery and content. Recommended episodes are listed here: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/12-homework/.

Feedback (5 min)
The Trainer(s) will ask for feedback on the day in some form.

Reflecting on the Day (5 min)
Before we wrap up for the day, take 5 minutes to think over everything we covered today. On a piece of paper, write down something that captures what you want to remember about the day. The Trainers won't look at this - it's just for you.
If you don't know where to start, consider the following list for a starting point:
draw a concept map, connecting the material
draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
write an outline of the topics we covered
write a paragraph or "journal" entry about your experience of the training today
write down one thing that struck you the most

X. Welcome Back

Questions (5-10 min)
Yesterday we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentries workshops. Please add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad. We will answer these questions in the etherpad during your work time and will return to this list later today.

Key Points
Instructors guide learners to construct the proper big picture (accurate mental model) of the topic rather than focus on details.
Instructors rely on frequent feedback from learners to monitor their own presentation of the material.
Instructors introduce a few concepts at a time to avoid cognitive overload.
The best way to motivate learners? Show them how to do something they can immediately put to use and be enthusiastic about it.
Teaching is a learned skill.

XI. Live Coding is a Skill

Why Participatory Live Coding?

Up and Down (10 min)
List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from both a learner's and an instructor's point of view.






Compare and Contrast (15 min)
Watch the two live coding videos as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Etherpad. Use the 2x2 rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.
In the videos, the bash shell for loop is taught, and it is assumed learners are familiar with how to use a variable, the head command and the content of the basilisk.dat unicorn.dat files.

Top Ten Tips for Participatory Live Coding in a Workshop

Sticky Notes

Practice Teaching (25 min)
Teach 3 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding to one or two fellow trainees, then swap and watch while the other person(s) live codes for you. Explain in advance to your fellow trainee(s) what you will be teaching and what the learners you teach it to are expected to be familiar with. Don't record the live coding sessions. Give each other feedback using the 2x2 rubric we discussed previously and enter the feedback you received in the below. 



Key Points
Live coding forces the instructor to slow down.
Coding-along gives learners continuous practice and feedback.
Mistakes made during participatory live coding are valuable learning opportunities.


XII. Preparing to Teach

Learner Profiles

Learner Profiles (10 min)
Read Software Carpentry's learner profiles ( https://software-carpentry.org/audience/ ). Note that these example profiles contain more information than you will ever know about a learner; this is a creative exercise in imagining (and empathizing with) the whole people behind the faces. Now, sketch out a profile of someone you might expect to attend your first workshop. Who are they, what problems do they face, and how might this training help them? Be as specific as possible.
Enter your learner profile below.



Reverse Instructional Design (and Preparation!)

Working With Learning Objectives

Evaluate Carpentries Learning Objectives (10 min)
Select one learning objective from one of the lessons linked to below and then complete the following steps to evaluate it.

****[INSERT links here]****

Identify the learning objective verb. How specifically does this verb describe the desired learner outcome?
Where does this verb fit on Bloom's taxonomy? Do you think this is an appropriate level for your learners?
In your opinion, does the lesson do an effective job of meeting the stated objective?
What would the next level on Bloom's taxonomy look like for your learners? How might you be able to help them think ahead to the next level without attempting to get them there during your workshop?

Using Formative Assessments

Where are your checkpoints? (10 min)

Have a look at your lesson again. Choose a learning objective, and identify where in the lesson that objective should reasonably be achieved. How will you know that that objective has been met for all learners? Will this be clear to them?

Make a plan for where in your lesson you will use different types of formative assessment to help everyone in the room monitor their progress. Keep in mind that formative assessment can can take many forms, including multiple choice questions, faded examples, spontaneous questions and calls for sticky notes. 

Write some notes or thoughts about this process below for discussion.

Feedback on Your Challenges (Optional, 15 min)
With these goals in mind, pair up with a partner to discuss the MCQ and faded example problems that you wrote yesterday. Give each other specific, actionable feedback that follows our 2x2 framework. Use that feedback to make at least one modification to your exercise(s). Discuss in the Etherpad the change you made and how it will help you get more useful information about your learners.

Key Points
To teach effectively, you have to know *who* you are teaching.
Good learning objectives communicate the intended effect of a lesson on its learners.
A good exercise provides useful guidance to instructors about next steps needed in teaching.



XIII. More Practice Live Coding

Round Two (45 min)
First, have a look at the rubric that is given to trainers as a suggested framework for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions that are part of instructor checkout. Does this rubric make sense? Take a moment to think about things you'd like to do differently with your next live coding practice. This is also a good time to ask questions about teaching demonstration.

Next, get back into the same groups you did your live coding with. Take turns re-teaching your chosen live coding session, making sure to incorporate changes based on the feedback you received and any new ideas based on reading the rubric. Give feedback to each other using the rubric this time. 

When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the Etherpad: What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How might you do it if you were to teach it again?


Key Points
(Reflective) Practice makes perfect.


XIV. Managing a Diverse Classroom


What Are the Challenges? (5 min)
What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching learners with a broad range of expertise? Discuss with a partner and put your thoughts in the Etherpad.


Code of Conduct Violations


Never Teach Alone: How to Be a Co-Instructor

Teaching Together - Nuts and Bolts
With a partner, imagine that you are planning a workshop together and answer the following questions:

How would you prepare to teach a workshop together?
During the workshop, what are some things the assisting instructor can do (or shouldn't do!) to support the main instructor?
As an entire group, discuss what you came up with and then compare to the recommendations below.


Minute Cards Revisited (5 min)
Use your sticky notes to write minute cards as discussed yesterday.

Key Points
Working with a broad range of learners can be challenging, but there are many ways to keep a classroom happy and motivated.
Response to a Code-of-Conduct violation at a workshop is subject to instructor discretion, but all violations should be reported to the Carpentries for follow-up.

XV. Checkout Process

Application Form

Instructor Checkout

Checking Out Review with Questions & Answers (5 min)
In small groups, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures. Make notes in the etherpad and when you're done, report back to the full group about the requirements for that stage of the process. What questions do you still have about the checkout process?

Schedule a Discussion or Demo (5 min)
Visit the discussion Etherpad to sign up for a session. If the session you would like to attend is full, contact the discussion host and co-host to ask if you can attend.

If you'd prefer to do your teaching demonstration before your discussion, visit the demo Etherpad and sign up there.

Lesson Contribution

What's in a Badge?

Check Out the Discussion (Optional)
As an instructor, your voice is important! We want you to be actively involved in discussions about the lesson materials (and other aspects of the Carpentries community). Go to the GitHub page for the lesson you worked with over the past two days and click on the "Issues" tab. Read through some of the discussions and, if you have anything to add, please add it to the conversation! If you wish to make a pull request, be sure to examine the contribution guidelines for the repository you are working in. If you do make a significant contribution to the discussion, send a link to the issue to checkout@carpentries.org. Congratulations! You've just completed one of the three remaining steps in becoming a Carpentries instructor.

Key Points
To certify, you must contribute to a lesson, take part in a discussion, and do a teaching demo within 90 days of your training event.


XVI. The Carpentries: How We Operate

Brief History

Similarities and Differences Between The Carpentries Lesson Programs

The Carpentry Community

Participating in the Carpentries: What's Your Role?
If you are at an in-person training, your instructor will hand out paper copies of a worksheet. If you are at an online training, you can get a digital copy at https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Carpentries_roles_worksheet_v4.pdf.

Take a moment to review member community roles on the Carpentries' communitiy website ( http://static.carpentries.org/community/ ). Working on your own, match up the roles with the descriptions. When you are done, think about the question at the bottom of the worksheet about what roles you might play, and enter your thoughts in the etherpad.

Setting Up

Practice With Carpentries Infrastructure (25 min)
Go to the workshop template repository ( https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template ) and follow the directions to create a workshop website using your local location and today's date. Put the link for your workshop website below.
Note: Sometimes web browsers will cache the workshop webpage, so when you make changes in Github, they don't show up on the workshop webpage immediately. Two ways to avoid this are to use a "private" or "incognito" mode in your web browser or by following the instructions at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache to bypass your browser cache.



Question and Answer (10 min)
What questions do you have about running and teaching at a workshop? Talk with a partner and enter your questions below. At this time we will also return to discuss questions remaining from the beginning of the day.


A Culture of Contribution


Key Points
Carpentry materials are all openly licensed, but Software and Data Carpentry names and logos are trademarked.
Carpentry workshops must cover core concepts, have at least one certified instructor, use our pre- and post-workshop surveys, and report attendance information.


XVII. Workshop Introductions

Setting the Workshop Environment

Your Academic Past (5 min)
Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like. 
How did those courses start on the first day? 
Were you confident in the instructors abilities? 
Did you feel like they were enthusiastic about the course and invested in you? 
Was it clear what you were going to be learning? 
Were you excited about the material? 
Did you leave that first day thinking the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the students they wanted to be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?


What's in an Introduction? (10 min)
Get into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the questions below for 5 minutes. Take notes on your answers.
What do you hope to accomplish in a workshop introduction?
What information do you need to include in an introduction to accomplish these goals?
After 5 minutes, come together, and combine ideas as a large group.
Compare your ideas with the list of topics below. 
Did you miss anything?
Did you come up with something that's not listed below?

Optional question: what did you (the leader) do or not do in your introduction to the session?

Goals For the Introduction

Components of the Introduction

Practice Your Introduction (15-25 min)
Imagine you have completed instructor training and you are about to teach a full lesson around the material you have been practicing teaching today.

Write out some notes, covering some of the topics described above:
Introduce yourself effectively
Clarify learning objectives and expectations
Set the tone for the workshop
Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and each give 2 minutes of your introduction.
After each introduction, provide 2-3 minutes of feedback.

Key Points
A planned introduction is a helpful tool in setting the workshop environment.
Introductions should include both practical information and start building relationships.


XVIII. Putting It Together

Picking up the Pieces (optional)
In small groups or on your own, make a list of all the concepts you've encountered in this training. Your list can include everything from educational/teaching theories to specific in-classroom practices.


Organize Your Knowledge 
Let's put the pieces together by creating a visual organization of information.
We suggest doing this in two ways:

If you are comfortable with / like concept maps, trying integrating all the topics above into a single concept map.
Use the provided handout to organize topics. Here are two examples:
Handout One ( https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Wrap-Up-doc.pdf, with example content: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Wrap-Up-doc-example.pdf )
Handout Two ( https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Carpentries_teaching_practices.pdf )
Work on this on your own. There's no "right answer" -- this is about you building up a mental model, moving from "novice" to "competent practitioner".

Once you've organized your thoughts, move to the next exercise.

Parting Thoughts
If you didn't think about these issues when organizing your topics in the previous exercise, now consider:
What is your mental model of teaching?
Can you identify why each topic above applies to teaching for the Carpentries?

Key Points
Having a plan makes it easier for you to remember to implement the important teaching practices you've learned.

XIX. Wrapping Up

One Up, One Down (5 min)
Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire two-day course.
Just as in our regular workshops, we collect post-instructor-training-workshop feedback. Your participation will help us evaluate the efficacy of this training and improve the content and delivery of the lesson materials.

Minute Cards (5 min)
In addition to giving one up, one down feedback. Please also fill out your sticky notes to give your instructors anonymous feedback.

Post Workshop Surveys (5 min)
Assessment is very important to us! Please complete this five-minute post-workshop survey. (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/post-instructor-training )

Key Points
Feedback applies to all kinds of learning, including learning how to teach.
