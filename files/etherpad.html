You can use the same subject about which you created a multiple choice question, or a different subject. Trade with a partner, and critique each other&#8217;s maps. Are there any concepts missing in your partner&#8217;s map that you would include? Are there more than a handful of concepts in your map? If so, how would you re-divide those concepts to avoid overwhelming your learners&#8217; working memory?<br>Take 10 minutes to draw the concept maps and share with your neighbor.

(Optional)</strong><br>As with computational skills, people have a tendency to think of teaching as something you are &#8220;just good at&#8221; or not. However, teaching is a skill, and expertise develops with attentive practice. Examine the descriptions of &#8220;novice,&#8221; &#8220;competent practitioner,&#8221; and &#8220;expert.&#8221; Where do you think you fall with regard to teaching? What have you learned about teaching? What are you aware of that you still need to learn?

Wrap-Up and Homework for Tomorrow</strong><br><br>To prepare for tomorrow, please:<br><ol class="number"><li>Read about the two types of Carpentries workshops: self-organized (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;datacarpentry&#x2e;org&#x2F;self&#x2d;organized&#x2d;workshops&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacarpentry.org&#x2F;self-organized-workshops&#x2F;</a> ) and centrally-organized (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;datacarpentry&#x2e;org&#x2F;workshops&#x2d;host&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacarpentry.org&#x2F;workshops-host&#x2F;</a> ) and the checklists these pages link to.&nbsp;</li><li>Prepare for the live coding exercises. If you haven&#8217;t already, pick an episode from an existing Software, Data or Library Carpentry lesson and read through it carefully. Tomorrow, you will use this to practice live coding for 3 minutes in groups of three. Your group members will comment on the delivery and content. Recommended episodes are listed here: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries&#x2e;github&#x2e;io&#x2F;instructor&#x2d;training&#x2F;12&#x2d;homework&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.github.io&#x2F;instructor-training&#x2F;12-homework&#x2F;</a>.</ol><br><strong>Feedback (5 min)</strong><br>The Trainer(s) will ask for feedback on the day in some form.<br><br><strong>Reflecting on the Day (5 min)</strong><br>Before we wrap up for the day, take 5 minutes to think over everything we covered today. On a piece of paper, write down something that captures what you want to remember about the day. The Trainers won&#8217;t look at this - it&#8217;s just for you.<br>If you don&#8217;t know where to start, consider the following list for a starting point:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>draw a concept map, connecting the material</li><li>draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day&#8217;s concepts</li><li>write an outline of the topics we covered</li><li>write a paragraph or &#8220;journal&#8221; entry about your experience of the training today</li><li>write down one thing that struck you the most</ul><br><strong>X. Welcome Back</strong><br><br><strong>Questions (5-10 min)</strong><br>Yesterday we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentries workshops. Please add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad. We will answer these questions in the etherpad during your work time and will return to this list later today.<br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Instructors guide learners to construct the proper big picture (accurate mental model) of the topic rather than focus on details.</li><li>Instructors rely on frequent feedback from learners to monitor their own presentation of the material.</li><li>Instructors introduce a few concepts at a time to avoid cognitive overload.</li><li>The best way to motivate learners?

Preparing to Teach</strong><br><br><strong>Learner Profiles</strong><br><br><strong>Learner Profiles (10 min)</strong><br>Read Software Carpentry&#x27;s learner profiles ( <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;software&#x2d;carpentry&#x2e;org&#x2F;audience&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software-carpentry.org&#x2F;audience&#x2F;</a> ). Note that these example profiles contain more information than you will ever know about a learner; this is a creative exercise in imagining (and empathizing with) the whole people behind the faces. Now, sketch out a profile of someone you might expect to attend your first workshop. Who are they, what problems do they face, and how might this training help them? Be as specific as possible.<br>Enter your learner profile below.<br><br><br><br><strong>Reverse Instructional Design (and Preparation!)</strong><br><br><strong>Working With Learning Objectives</strong><br><br><strong>Evaluate Carpentries Learning Objectives (10 min)</strong><br>Select one learning objective from one of the lessons linked to below and then complete the following steps to evaluate it.<br><br><strong>****[INSERT links here]****</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Identify the learning objective verb. How specifically does this verb describe the desired learner outcome?</li><li>Where does this verb fit on Bloom&#8217;s taxonomy? Do you think this is an appropriate level for your learners?</li><li>In your opinion, does the lesson do an effective job of meeting the stated objective?</li><li>What would the next level on Bloom&#8217;s taxonomy look like for your learners? How might you be able to help them think ahead to the next level without attempting to get them there during your workshop?</ul><br><strong>Using Formative Assessments</strong><br><br><strong>Where are your checkpoints? (10 min)</strong><br><br>Have a look at your lesson again. Choose a learning objective, and identify where in the lesson that objective should reasonably be achieved. How will you know that that objective has been met for all learners? Will this be clear to them?<br><br>Make a plan for where in your lesson you will use different types of formative assessment to help everyone in the room monitor their progress. Keep in mind that formative assessment can can take many forms, including multiple choice questions, faded examples, spontaneous questions and calls for sticky notes.&nbsp;<br><br>Write some notes or thoughts about this process below for discussion.<br><br><strong>Feedback on Your Challenges (Optional, 15 min)</strong><br>With these goals in mind, pair up with a partner to discuss the MCQ and faded example problems that you wrote yesterday. Give each other specific, actionable feedback that follows our 2x2 framework. Use that feedback to make at least one modification to your exercise(s). Discuss in the Etherpad the change you made and how it will help you get more useful information about your learners.<br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>To teach effectively, you have to know *who* you are teaching.</li><li>Good learning objectives communicate the intended effect of a lesson on its learners.</li><li>A good exercise provides useful guidance to instructors about next steps needed in teaching.</ul><br><br><br><strong>XIII. More Practice Live Coding</strong><br><br><strong>Round Two (45 min)</strong><br>First, have a look at the rubric that is given to trainers as a suggested framework for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions that are part of instructor checkout. Does this rubric make sense? Take a moment to think about things you&#8217;d like to do differently with your next live coding practice. This is also a good time to ask questions about teaching demonstration.<br><br>Next, get back into the same groups you did your live coding with. Take turns re-teaching your chosen live coding session, making sure to incorporate changes based on the feedback you received and any new ideas based on reading the rubric. Give feedback to each other using the rubric this time.&nbsp;<br><br>When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the Etherpad: What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How might you do it if you were to teach it again?<br><br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>(Reflective) Practice makes perfect.</ul><br><br><strong>XIV. Managing a Diverse Classroom</strong><br><br><br><strong>What Are the Challenges?

At this time we will also return to discuss questions remaining from the beginning of the day.<br><br><br><strong>A Culture of Contribution</strong><br><br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Carpentry materials are all openly licensed, but Software and Data Carpentry names and logos are trademarked.</li><li>Carpentry workshops must cover core concepts, have at least one certified instructor, use our pre- and post-workshop surveys, and report attendance information.</ul><br><br><strong>XVII. Workshop Introductions</strong><br><br><strong>Setting the Workshop Environment</strong><br><br><strong>Your Academic Past (5 min)</strong><br>Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn&#8217;t like.&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>How did those courses start on the first day?&nbsp;</li><li>Were you confident in the instructors abilities?&nbsp;</li><li>Did you feel like they were enthusiastic about the course and invested in you?&nbsp;</li><li>Was it clear what you were going to be learning?&nbsp;</li><li>Were you excited about the material?&nbsp;</li><li>Did you leave that first day thinking the instructor was uninterested, that you weren&#8217;t the students they wanted to be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?</ul><br><br><strong>What&#x27;s in an Introduction? (10 min)</strong><br>Get into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the questions below for 5 minutes. Take notes on your answers.<br><ul class="bullet"><li>What do you hope to accomplish in a workshop introduction?</li><li>What information do you need to include in an introduction to accomplish these goals?</ul>After 5 minutes, come together, and combine ideas as a large group.<br>Compare your ideas with the list of topics below.&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Did you miss anything?</li><li>Did you come up with something that&#8217;s not listed below?</ul><br>Optional question: what did you (the leader) do or not do in your introduction to the session?<br><br><strong>Goals For the Introduction</strong><br><ul class="indent"><li></ul><strong>Components of the Introduction</strong><br><br><strong>Practice Your Introduction (15-25 min)</strong><br>Imagine you have completed instructor training and you are about to teach a full lesson around the material you have been practicing teaching today.<br><br><ol class="number"><li>Write out some notes, covering some of the topics described above:<ol class="number"><li>Introduce yourself effectively</li><li>Clarify learning objectives and expectations</li><li>Set the tone for the workshop</ol><li>Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and each give 2 minutes of your introduction.</li><li>After each introduction, provide 2-3 minutes of feedback.</ol><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>A planned introduction is a helpful tool in setting the workshop environment.</li><li>Introductions should include both practical information and start building relationships.</ul><br><br><strong>XVIII. Putting It Together</strong><br><br><strong>Picking up the Pieces (optional)</strong><br>In small groups or on your own, make a list of all the concepts you&#8217;ve encountered in this training. Your list can include everything from educational&#x2F;teaching theories to specific in-classroom practices.<br><br><br><strong>Organize Your Knowledge&nbsp;</strong><br>Let&#8217;s put the pieces together by creating a visual organization of information.<br>We suggest doing this in two ways:<br><br><ol class="number"><li>If you are comfortable with &#x2F; like concept maps, trying integrating all the topics above into a single concept map.</li><li>Use the provided handout to organize topics. Here are two examples:</ol><ul class="bullet"><li><ul class="bullet"><li>Handout One ( <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries&#x2e;github&#x2e;io&#x2F;instructor&#x2d;training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Wrap&#x2d;Up&#x2d;doc&#x2e;pdf">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.github.io&#x2F;instructor-training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Wrap-Up-doc.pdf</a>, with example content: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries&#x2e;github&#x2e;io&#x2F;instructor&#x2d;training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Wrap&#x2d;Up&#x2d;doc&#x2d;example&#x2e;pdf">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.github.io&#x2F;instructor-training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Wrap-Up-doc-example.pdf</a> )</li><li>Handout Two ( <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries&#x2e;github&#x2e;io&#x2F;instructor&#x2d;training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Carpentries&#x5f;teaching&#x5f;practices&#x2e;pdf">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.github.io&#x2F;instructor-training&#x2F;files&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;Carpentries_teaching_practices.pdf</a> )</ul></li></ul>Work on this on your own. There&#8217;s no &#8220;right answer&#8221; &#8211; this is about you building up a mental model, moving from &#8220;novice&#8221; to &#8220;competent practitioner&#8221;.<br><br>Once you&#8217;ve organized your thoughts, move to the next exercise.<br><br><strong>Parting Thoughts</strong><br>If you didn&#8217;t think about these issues when organizing your topics in the previous exercise, now consider:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>What is your mental model of teaching?</li><li>Can you identify why each topic above applies to teaching for the Carpentries?</ul><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Having a plan makes it easier for you to remember to implement the important teaching practices you&#8217;ve learned.</ul><br><strong>XIX. Wrapping Up</strong><br><br><strong>One Up, One Down (5 min)</strong><br>Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire two-day course.<br>Just as in our regular workshops, we collect post-instructor-training-workshop feedback. Your participation will help us evaluate the efficacy of this training and improve the content and delivery of the lesson materials.<br><br><strong>Minute Cards (5 min)</strong><br>In addition to giving one up, one down feedback. Please also fill out your sticky notes to give your instructors anonymous feedback.<br><br><strong>Post Workshop Surveys (5 min)</strong><br>Assessment is very important to us! Please complete this five-minute post-workshop survey.
